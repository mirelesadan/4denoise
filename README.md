# About the Project
**4Denoise** is a Python package for advanced processing, visualizing, and denoising 4D-STEM datasets.

This package is used for processing of data in "**Strain Mapping of Three-dimensionally Structured Two-dimensional Materials**"
See the Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/17246822) record for the MoS<sub>2</sub>â€“MoSe<sub>2</sub> heterojunction 4D-STEM dataset (`scan_x256_y256.raw`) and the simulated ripple dataset (`simulated_4d_dataset_highRes.npy`)
