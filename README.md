⚠️ **Status (Oct 14, 2025)**: We are updating this package to ensure full reproducibility of the results in **_“Strain Mapping of Three-dimensionally Structured Two-dimensional Materials”_**, including Jupyter notebooks and detailed, step-by-step instructions.

# About the Project
**4Denoise** is a Python package for advanced processing, visualizing, and denoising 4D-STEM datasets.

This package is used for processing of data in _"**Strain Mapping of Three-dimensionally Structured Two-dimensional Materials**"_
See the Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/17246822) record for the MoS<sub>2</sub>–MoSe<sub>2</sub> heterojunction 4D-STEM dataset (`scan_x256_y256.raw`) and the simulated ripple dataset (`simulated_4d_dataset_highRes.npy`)
